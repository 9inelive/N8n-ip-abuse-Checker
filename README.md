# N8n-ip-abuse-Checker
This n8n workflow checks any IP addressâ€™s reputation using the AbuseIPDB API. Send an IP via webhook, and it fetches abuse confidence scores, country info, and last reported date. The results are formatted and sent to a Discord channel for real-time alerts. Easy to set up and customize for monitoring.
